# Circuit Solver  :))  ***Short your time, we open your answer***

**Have you ever fed up of solving complicated circuits with lots of bridges and pillars ?**

*Fret Not!! You have then reached the right place, this is a computer aided software, that solves you any kind of resistive circuit instantly in no pain.*

## Features

* Flexibility to design and simulate any kind of resistive circuit.
* Can edit the circuit the circuit at any instant of time.
* Option to save the circuit that you have built, as a PNG file.
* The internal lgorithm, itself does all the node planning.
* The feature of Undo/Redo and a delete option to efficiently use the canvas for deisgning the circuits.
* You can analyze any kind of resistive circuit.
* This can solve complicated circuits with any type of controlled sources too. 
* Easy to handle user interface as simple as drag and drop.

## Working principle
We have algorithmically implemented the technique of ***Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)*** for solving any kind of resistive circuit. MNA is an advanced version of the existing principle of nodal analysis, in which some changes are made so as to implement it using any computer program. This is our basic implementation of the complete project of a circuit solver. In this preliminary version we have just implemented the backend process of MNA. Here the user must do all the node planning and enter the correct inputs(number of elements, number of nodes, each element type and it's details) as prompted by the software. 

## Instructions
Computer is the foolest thing in the world, which blindly just processes the inputs that is being fed into it. Hence here are few basic instructions that must be followed while using this software. The UI is very much simple and it is completely a drag and drop kind of feature in the canvas.

## Disclaimer
This is a computer aided software and hence there is no gaurentee by the developers for ensuring the creditability of the results that the software outputs. Though the softare has been tested against a large number of custom inputs, there are situations where it can fail. If you come across any such problem, please feel free to rise a issue here or provide your feedback in the website and we will try to address the issue as soon as possible.
